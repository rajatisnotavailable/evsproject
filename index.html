          Major demographic and socio-economic changes between 2000 and 2010,
          such as increasing population, increasing incomes, rural to urban
          migrations, and an increase in rural per capita productivity has
          resulted in major shifts in food consumption trends and production
          patterns. Consumption demand is increasing, as Indiaâ€™s per capita GDP
          is expected to increase by 320% in the next 20 years[1], with a
          parallel increase in overall food consumption by 4% per annum. Indians
          are now spending much more on high value foods, and consumption is
          shifting from plant-based to animal-based protein, thanks to
          increasing disposable incomes and rapidly evolving consumer needs. And
          while agricultural productivity grew over the last decade, there has
          been a qualitative shift from basic foodgrains to high value
          agriculture, especially fruits and vegetables. Between 2000 and 2010,
          high value produce moved from forming 38% to 45% of total produce by
          weight. The increase in the production of certain high value foods
          such as soya bean, potato, mango, banana, and poultry has been up to
          four times faster than basic produce like rice and wheat

          At the same time it says that the industry presently achieves only 50
          to 60% of the potential yield for most crops due to poor technology
          adoption; weak links between farmers and industry; unexplored
          opportunities in branding, marketing and exports; lack of end-to-end
          infrastructure from farm to table; and a dearth of extension support,
          research and innovation, and entrepreneurship.

         The economic growth in a country eventually leads
         to a shift in food preferences and consumption pattern
         and affects nutritional status of the people. For better
         health and elimination of malnutrition, a diversified
         and balanced food basket is required (Sangeetha et al.,
         2013). During the past 50 years, agricultural production
         environment, practices and culture have changed and
         crop breeding programmes have made farmers less
         dependent on seasons (Kearney, 2010). Family farming
         played a key role in securing food and nutrition security
         in India (Singh et al., 2014), however, in recent years
         market-driven agriculture has made a significant impact
         on food consumption pattern of rural households, and
         urbanization and rising income levels have changed
         consumption habits of urban households. The studies
         on agriculture focused on production pattern, crop
         diversification and their determinants (Chand, 1996;
         Joshi et al., 2003; Kumar and Gupta, 2015) and
         nutrition have emphasized on the consumption of
         calories, micro and macro nutrients intake and
         importance of diversified food consumption for better
         health (Drescher et al., 2007; Lumole, 2013;
         Viswanathan et al., 2015).

         The data on food production, per-capita availability
         and consumption of various food items and its
         expenditure share, per-capita income, population,
urbanization, per-capita intake of calorie, protein and
fats were collected for the past two decades, 1990-2010
from the government published reports like various
rounds of National Sample Survey Organisation survey,
National Family Health Survey (NFHS), and economic
survey. State level information on production of crops,
livestock products and fisheries was collected from
various published sources such as Horticulture at a
Glance (GoI, 2015) and Agricultural Statistics at a
Glance (GoI, 2014) and government website (https://
data.gov.in/). Data on other related factors like statewise percentage of urban population, literacy rate, etc.
were collected from the census data (http://
censusindia.gov.in/). The data on gross state domestic
product (GSDP) and poverty estimates were collected
from Planning Commission, Government of India
(http://planningcommission.gov.in/). All monetary
values were converted into real terms by using GDP
deflator
